# PipeDreams

- This is an ongoing personal project for my team and myself, i work on this after hours in freetime. so it has been a slow but fun process so far trying to figure out
- how to build a Pipeline!

currently, PipeDreams is a basic Pipeline (mostly currently just a DCC launcher for now) 
that allows a large team of 3D artists to work seemlessly together on the same projects,
it modifies the 3D package to a specific project environment, provides core tools for the DCC, such as a Scene Manager, Export Manager and a Capture Manager,
these set of tools allows for the automotation of repetitive importing and exporting of assets, while keeping the file structure and naming conventions neat
with versioning control.
