- This is an ongoing personal project for myself, for my team, i work on this after hours in my freetime, so it has been a slow but fun process so far trying to figure out
  how to build a Pipeline!

- Currently, PipeDreams is a basic Pipeline (mostly a DCC launcher for now) 
  that allows a large team of 3D artists to work seemlessly together on the same projects,
  it modifies the 3D package to a specific project environment, provides core tools for the DCC, such as a Scene Manager, Export Manager and a Capture Manager,
  these set of tools allows for the automotation of repetitive importing and exporting of assets, while keeping the file structure and naming conventions neat
  with versioning control.

- Users can choose and save custom icons and minimize the tool, alternatively this feature can be overridden by admin and force a companies logo instead.

- Capture Manager.

- Capture Manager goes through a compositing process to format a version of a capture for dailies, it collect scene data and displays it in this capture too along with
  company logo, ideally this capture would be used by Ftrack etc, unfortunatly i dont have access to Ftrack to be able to implement it.

All these tools are in a very rough state, and needs loads of love and work! =)
